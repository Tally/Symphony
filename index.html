		<h3>Operation: Code a Cool Website Called 'Symphony'</h3>
		<p>Symphony will be a web application for collectively suggesting music. Users will be able to receive music suggestions based on the information attached to the suggestion and the information's emphasis. For example, a suggestion might be be highlighted because genre tags you enjoy were emphasized or the suggestion was recommended to you emphatically or specifically. The site will also provide rudimentary information regarding the suggestion, but will serve primarily as a means to remember or organize suggestions and only a gateway to actually experiencing them, via a YouTube or Bandcamp link.</p>
